I’m a student who’s currently exploring, learning, and building my way through tech.

Right now, I’m focused on understanding how things work at a practical level. I enjoy experimenting with code, hardware, and small projects that help turn concepts into something real. I’m still early in the journey, so my goal is simple: learn deeply, stay curious, and improve step by step.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- Python  
- Arduino & IoT fundamentals  
- Web basics: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  

## 🔧 What I Use GitHub For
- Practicing concepts and fundamentals  
- College-related work  
- Small experiments and learning projects  
- Trying out ideas as I learn new tools  

## 🧠 How I Approach Learning
I prefer learning by doing. I like breaking things, fixing them, and understanding why they work the way they do. I’m intentionally keeping my path open to explore different roles and technologies before narrowing my focus.
